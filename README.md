# Sample-Scripts

This repository is a collection of my personal scripts prepared to this date. The intent of this repository is to house work I have done not specifically related to 
an organizational project and/or another GitHub project, and to showcase work that I have done in order to demonstrate knowledge that I already possess and skills that
I can further utilize in the future. As of January 2021, this repository will primarily contain Python scripts, with some basic shell scripts I have composed as well.
